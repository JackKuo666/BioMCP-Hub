# BioMCP-Hub Architecture

🚀 **System Architecture for Bioinformatics MCP Platform**

## 📌 Overview
BioMCP-Hub is designed as a **modular microservice-based platform** that enables **biological data analysis, model training, workflow automation, and literature/data retrieval**. The architecture is centered around **MCP Hub**, which serves as the communication core, orchestrating various **MCP-enabled services**.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **User Request:** A user sends a query (e.g., genome alignment, PubMed search) via the API.
2. **MCP Hub Processing:** The **hub.py** routes the request to the corresponding module.
3. **MCP Module Execution:** The selected module (e.g., `sequence_alignment`) processes the request and returns results.
4. **Result Storage & API Response:** The processed data is stored and served back to the user.

## 🧩 Core Components
### **1️⃣ MCP Hub**
- Manages communication between users and modules.
- Ensures **secure, structured, and scalable** interaction.

### **2️⃣ Bioinformatics Modules**
- **Genome Analysis**: Performs sequence analysis, variant calling, annotation.
- **Sequence Alignment**: Aligns sequences using BLAST, Clustal Omega, etc.
- **Data Search**: Fetches literature and biological datasets from PubMed, NCBI, UniProt, etc.

### **3️⃣ Storage & Data Management**
- Uses **local storage** for temporary data.
- Can integrate with **cloud storage (AWS S3, GCS)**.
- Supports **databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for structured metadata.**

### **4️⃣ Deployment Options**
- 🐳 **Docker**: Each module runs as a microservice.
- ☁️ **Kubernetes**: Scalable cluster-based deployment.
- 🔬 **HPC/SLURM**: Compatible with high-performance computing environments.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Integration with **deep learning models** for genomic prediction.
- ✅ AI-driven **automated literature summarization**.
- ✅ Real-time **data streaming and visualization**.
